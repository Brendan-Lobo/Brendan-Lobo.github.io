# Work Experience

### Undergraduate Researcher

***[Guenther Laboratory](https://guentherlab.mie.utoronto.ca/) - University of Toronto***
*May - Aug. 2023, Sep. 2023 - Apr. 2024*

- Characterized the propagation of pressure waves through non-Newtonian fluids in microfluidic channels via particle image velocimetry (PIV).
- Created custom DC-electrical circuits to synchronize pressure wave generation with PIV measurements.
- Utilized SU-8 soft-lithography, FDM & multi-jet 3D printing, laser cutting, and manual machining to construct experimental setups designed with SOLIDWORKS and AutoCAD.

### Assistant TA Training Platform Administrator

***[FASE](https://www.engineering.utoronto.ca/) - University of Toronto***
*Jan. - Feb. 2021, Feb. - Mar. 2021, Sep. - Nov. 2021, Nov. 2021, Aug. - Nov. 2022, Jan. - Apr. 2023, May - Aug. 2023, Aug. - Sep. 2023, Sep. - Nov. 2023, Nov. - Dec. 2023*

- Reduced TA training evaluation times from 4 hours to a few seconds by coding a Python script that auto-evaluates a TA’s training completion based on their working group’s criteria.
- Converted the auto-evaluation Python script into an Excel macro using Visual Basic for Applications to prevent a drop in efficiency from future non-technical staff.
- Co-created an interactive training platform using the Canvas LMS for virtual training of engineering TAs

### Teaching Assistant (TA)

***[APS100](https://engineering.calendar.utoronto.ca/course/aps100h1) - University of Toronto***
*Sep. - Dec. 2022, Sep. - Dec. 2023*

- Led and managed a tutorial class of over 40 first-year engineering students and provided guidance on topics such as time management, engineering ethics and academic integrity.
- Helped students find and navigate resources available at U of T such as academic advisors and learning strategists.
- Provided training for new Teaching Assistants regarding facilitation and classroom management.
