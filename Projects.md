# 2024

>### ***Interactive TurtleBot***
>
>[**MIE443H1: Mechatronics Systems: Design and Integration**](https://engineering.calendar.utoronto.ca/course/mie443h1)
>
>*In this group project, we programmed a TurtleBot2 to be interactive using C++ in ROS. We started by creating an algorithm which the TurtleBot will use to scan an area using a LiDAR array and make a map. Next, we programmed the robot to visit key locations in the map and detect labels using its RGB camera and the OpenCV computer vision library. Finally, we programmed the TurtleBot to respond to external stimuli (e.g. hitting it or picking it up) using sounds and its display.*

>![MIE444 Rover](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Brendan-Lobo/Brendan-Lobo.github.io/main/assets/MIE444/TapeBot-SunShot.jpg)
>
>*In this group project, we built a Bluetooth controlled rover from scratch. The digital circuitry was based on the Arduino Mega 2560 Rev3 which controlled two NEMA 11 stepper motors for motion and one servo for the actuation of the scoop. The control logic was written in Python while the "drivers" were written in Arduino C.*
>
>*The robot was required to achieve three tasks without collisions with its surroundings:*
>
>1. *Locate its position in a known maze.*
>2. *Travel to a known loading zone.*
>3. *Pick up a block and deliver it to a known drop-off point.*
>
>*Tasks one was achieved autonomously using the control code. Tasks two and three was achieved manually using an on-screen GUI that displayed the robot's current position and its sensor readings.*
